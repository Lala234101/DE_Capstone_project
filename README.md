# DE_Capstone_project

# 🏥 Cloud-Based Healthcare Data Integration System
# 📌 Project Overview
This capstone project presents a cloud-focused data system built for the healthcare industry, designed to resolve the challenge of fragmented client data systems. The goal is to integrate disparate healthcare data sources—such as patient demographics, appointments, and treatment records—into a unified system hosted on Microsoft Azure.

The solution spans database modeling, ETL pipeline orchestration, and cloud infrastructure deployment, providing a scalable foundation for analytics and reporting.

# 🎯 Problem Statement
Healthcare organizations often struggle with fragmented data spread across multiple systems, making it difficult to generate timely insights for decision-making, care optimization, and regulatory compliance.

This project addresses that gap by:

Creating a centralized data warehouse in Azure PostgreSQL.

Ingesting, transforming, and loading data via a robust ETL pipeline.

Enabling scalable and secure analytics through cloud integration.

# 🔧 Tech Stack

Layer	Tools/Technologies
Database	PostgreSQL (Azure Database for PostgreSQL)
Pipeline	Python, Azure Data Factory (or Airflow)
Cloud	Microsoft Azure (Blob Storage, ADF, PostgreSQL)
Language	SQL, Python
Orchestration	Azure Data Factory Pipelines (or Airflow)

# 🗃️ Project Components

1. Database Modeling
Designed schema to integrate client, appointment, treatment, and billing data.

Implemented ERD and relational model in PostgreSQL.

Optimized with constraints, indexes, and normalization.

2. ETL Pipeline
Extracts raw data from multiple sources (CSV, APIs).

Transforms and validates using Python.

Loads into PostgreSQL hosted on Azure.

Orchestrated with Azure Data Factory.

3. Cloud Deployment
Azure PostgreSQL for centralized data storage.

Azure Blob Storage for raw data files.

Azure Data Factory for scheduled ETL workflows.

Role-based access and cost optimization strategies.
